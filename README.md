This repository contains several exercises to get us more comfortable with the Python we have learned so far. This has included:
- Types (int, float, bool, str)
- Operations on int and float (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
- Operations on bool (and, or, not)
- Operations on str (length, index, slicing)
- Variable compound assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=)
- Print statement syntax (use of , and +)
- Input statement syntax and use (use of , and +, and casting to other types)
