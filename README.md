This repository contains several exercises to get us more comfortable with the Python we have learned so far. This has included:
- Types (int, float, bool, str)
- Operations on int and float (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
- Operations on bool (and, or, not)
- Operations on str (length, index, slicing)
- Variable compound assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=)
- Print statement syntax (use of , and +)
- Input statement syntax and use (use of , and +, and casting to other types)

The three files named below have exercises that have you demonstrate knowledge of all of these skills:
- numberpractice.py
- booleanpractice.py
- stringpractice.py

There are also three solution files and three text files showing what the results should look like. Please note that your final outputs may look different due to different values being entered by the user, that's okay!
- numberpracticesolutions.py and numberpracticeoutput.txt
- booleanpracticesolutions.py and booleanpracticeoutput.txt
- stringpracticesolutions.py and stringpracticeoutput.txt
