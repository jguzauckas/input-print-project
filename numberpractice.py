#This file will have you practice integers and floats and operations on them.
#The context: Two people both have a bank account that this program will track.
#First, initialize two float variables, called "per1" and "per2" with two different amounts
#between 5k and 10k dollars by asking the user to enter float values. Print a statement
#regarding their initial balances: i.e. "Person 1 has ____ dollars and Person 2 has _____."


#It's Friday and for both people, their paychecks were deposited in their accounts.
#Person 1 received 1,422.76 and person 2 received 1,546.98.
#Use compound assignment statements to increase their bank balance appropriately and make a
#statement regarding their new balance:
#i.e. "After pay day, person 1 has ___ dollars and person 2 has ___ dollars"


#On Saturday, both people run some errands and spend some money.
#Person 1 spent 324.59 and person 2 spent 287.68.
#Use compound assignment statements to decrease their bank balance appropriately and make a
#statement regarding their new balance:
#i.e. "After errands, person 1 has ___ dollars and person 2 has ___ dollars"


#On Sunday, both people went to a local fair and entered in a raffle.
#Person 1 AND person 2 managed to win a prize that triples their money, 
#Use compound assignment statements to modify their bank balance
#appropriately and make a statement regarding their new balance:
#i.e. "After the fair, person 1 has ___ dollars and person 2 has ___ dollars"


#Over the next couple weeks, both people spent half of their money on various things.
#Use compound assignment statements to modify their bank balance appropriately and
#make a statement regarding their new balance:
#i.e. "After a couple weeks, person 1 has ___ dollars and person 2 has ___ dollars"


#Due to a banking error, both people's account values were divided by 1.5 and rounded down
#to the nearest whole dollar. Use compound assignment statements to modify their bank
#balance appropriately and make a statement regarding their new balance:
#i.e. "After the error, person 1 has ___ dollars and person 2 has ___ dollars"


#Both people left their accounts behind and went to another bank after the error,
#however they left their money behind. The money sat there for 50 years. Below I have created an
#interest rate for each person's account, titled "rate1" and "rate2"
rate1 = 1.025
rate2 = 1.02

#To calculate the new bank balance, you need to multiply the current bank account balance value
#(per1 and per2) by the interest rate (rate1 and rate2) raised to the power of the number of years.
#Note: This will use multiplication assignment with the rate raised to the power in parentheses
#(ex. var1 *= (var2 ** 50)) Modify their account balances appropriately and make a statement
#regarding their new balance: i.e. "After 50 years, person 1 has ___ dollars and person 2 has ___ dollars"


#Shortly after this interest is calculated and applied, both people write a will to determine what
#to do with their estate after they pass away. Person 1 wants to split their money between 5 different
#charities, and Person 2 wants to split their money between 10 different charities. The problem is,
#both only want to make whole number contributions to the charities, and leave any extra dollars and cents
#behind. After distributing their money, what will their final account balances be?
#Modify their account balances appropriately and make a statement regarding their new balance:
#i.e. "After they distribute their money, person 1 has ___ dollars and person 2 has ___ dollars"
